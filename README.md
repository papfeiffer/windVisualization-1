**Project Collaborators:** Dongmin Park and Paige Pfeiffer

# Description of Parameters
## Step size: 0.13
## Number of particles: 2800
## Lifetime: 200

We chose a step size that is fast enough to see the direction of the wind, but not too fast that you cannot follow the path of the wind. We tried values starting at 0.05 to 3. Any speed above 1.5 seemed to be too fast, but a range from 1 to 1.5 works well. The number of particles is important in perceiving the path of the wind. Any number below 2000 was too little to see how wind travelled, but any number above 3000 was too many points, in which the display space was too cluttered. We chose a lifetime of 200 because numbers below or above this value made the particles stay too long on the screen or die too fast to see the wind pattern. 

# Wizardly Work
We did not work on any extra features or elements to this project.
